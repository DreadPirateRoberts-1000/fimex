Implementation of vertical interpolation in fimex

Literature:
  * vcdata.f and sondat.f from mi-bin : preparing sonde comparison plots
    * nearly unreadable code - mostly converting to height? Using very simple
      formulars for translation of levels, and unexplained interpolations
  * ncl/NCAR: http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/vert_interp.shtml
    * good explanation of function-interface and explanation of what they do
    * lin, log, log-log interpolation
    * no source-code (legal restrictions)
    * nice reference, but most interesting for extrapolation:
       Vertical Interpolation and Truncation of Model-Coordinate Data
       Trenberth, Berry, Buja
       [NCAR/TN-396, 1993].
  * CF-Convention, App. D: http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.4/cf-conventions.html#dimensionless-v-coord
    * exact formulars to convert between dim-less pressure (sigma/hybrid) coordinates to pressure

 Implementation Plan:
  * concentrate on pressure-conversions (urgent task), no pressure-height conversion
    * C-impl. CF-formular for sigma->pressure, sigma-hybrid->pressure
  * C-impl. of pressure->pressure interpolation using lin,log,log-log
  * CDM/CoordSys:
    * detect dim-less coordinate and map to correct pressure formular
    * detect formular-terms: auxiliary variables (p, p_top, sigma, ...)
    * configurable interpolation methods for different variables, i.e.
      * log(p) default for most quantitities according to Trenberth et. al.
        => f(p) = m*log(p) + c
      * linear(p)
        => f(p) = m*p + c
      * log-log ?
        => f(p) = log(log(p)) + c
      * other schemes for geopotential (height/temperature) or mean sea level pressure,
        eventually best starting directly from hybrid-levels?
        * this will be very complicated, so ignoring in first version
        * see NCL vintp2p_ecmwf
