/**
 * Allows merge data from an inner, "fine" grid onto data from an outer, "rough" grid.
 *
 * The resulting grid will be defined by extending the inner grid of
 * the first variable merged with "addMergedVariable" with the inner
 * grid's step size until the limits of the outer grid for this
 * variable are reached. If necessary, the outer reader is
 * interpolated to this grid. In the area of the inner grid, the
 * values are replaced with those from the inner grid, by default with
 * a linear transition (fill values are handled specially).
 *
 * Present limitations:
 *
 * - all variables added for merging later must have the same
 *   horizontal axes as the first variable.
 *
 * - there is no check whether the shapes of a merged variables is
 *   compatible in inner and outer readers, only a warning if they are
 *   not equal
 *
 * - there is no check at all if other dimensions are compatible
