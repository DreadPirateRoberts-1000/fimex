fimex debian packages
=====================

A dsc file for debian package building may be generated by running the script

debian_files/gen_debsrc <output_dir> <debian_dir>

where <output_dir> specifies the directory where the dsc file shall be put, and
where <debian_dir> specifies a directory like "debian_precise".

Before running this script, you should have updated debian_.../changelog.

You should also make sure that the version in debian_.../changelog and
include/fimex/CDMconstants.h match, typically by editing both, touching configure.ac,
and running automake and autoconf.

The generated debian source package may the be built as usual.
